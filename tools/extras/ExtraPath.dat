COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /All three naturally-occurring hexitols can be utilized by bacteria as a total source of carbon and energy.
COMMENT - /Each of these hexitols enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system, so the first intracellular species is the 6-phospho-derivative |CITS: [1100608]| (note that due to symmetry of |FRAME: MANNITOL| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|, their phosphorylation at either end produces the same molecule. When these molecules are phosphorylated at the 6 position by the PTS system, the resulting molecules are named |FRAME: MANNITOL-1P| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL-1-PHOSPHATE|, respectively, by conventional nomenclature rules).
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In all three cases this sugar alcohol phosphate becomes the substrate for a dehydrogenase that oxidizes its 2-alcohol group to a keto group. In the cases of |FRAME: MANNITOL| and |FRAME: SORBITOL|, the resulting keto sugar phosphate is |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|, an intermediate of glycolysis, and hence it flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In the case of |FRAME: GALACTITOL-1-PHOSPHATE|, however, the product of the dehydrogenation is |FRAME: TAGATOSE-6-PHOSPHATE|, which becomes the substrate of a kinase and subsequently an aldolase (in a pair of reactions that parallel those of glycolysis) before it is converted into intermediates (|FRAME: GAP| and

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate
COMMENT - /the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine,
COMMENT - /purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis.
COMMENT - /Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism

COMMENT - /protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons)
COMMENT - /of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series
COMMENT - /of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually
COMMENT - /preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly

COMMENT - /<b>About This Pathway</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /This pathway for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of folates is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of a pterin, |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE| and |FRAME:GLT| moieties.
COMMENT - /The first two are synthesized from |FRAME:GTP| and |FRAME:CHORISMATE|, respectively.
COMMENT - /The first committed step catalyzed by |FRAME: FOLE-CPLX| converts GTP into |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3|.
COMMENT - /The triphosphate motif is removed by a still unknown process, and the resulting
COMMENT - /|FRAME: DIHYDRO-NEO-PTERIN| is converted to |FRAME: AMINO-OH-HYDROXYMETHYL-DIHYDROPTERIDINE|
COMMENT - /by |FRAME: CPLX0-3936| (FolB).
COMMENT - /The consecutive action of the FolK, FolP, FolC, and FolA enzymes finally produces the final product,
COMMENT - /|FRAME: THF| |CITS: [12039964]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pABA (synthesized

COMMENT - /mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743][11752472]|.
COMMENT - /The recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each
COMMENT - /of them encoded by a different gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least

COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In addition to the <i>de novo</i> pathway, many organisms also possess a salvage pathway that is used
COMMENT - /to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from breakdown products of folates in the cell, such as 5 or 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /<b>About Folates In Animals</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the <i>de novo</i>

COMMENT - /Food folates exist mainly as |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF| (5-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>)
COMMENT - /and |FRAME: 10-FORMYL-THF| (formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Polyglutamyl folates are hydrolyzed to folylmonoglutamates by |FRAME: HS06361-MONOMER|,

COMMENT - /This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin |CITS: [13906633][2736319]|,
COMMENT - /and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent
COMMENT - /|FRAME:ENZRXN-5465| to monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA "TCA cycle"|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules. Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it
COMMENT - /can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
COMMENT - /This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /<b>About This Pathway</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The standard glycolysis pathway (|FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS|) depicts the sugar input into the pathway as
COMMENT - /glucose. However, the glycolysis pathway is utilized for the degradation of many different types of sugars.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /This partial depiction of the glycolysis pathway is used with substrates other than glucose, such as |FRAME: ALLOSE|,
COMMENT - /|FRAME: CPD-9569| , |FRAME: MANNITOL| , |FRAME: SORBITOL| , |FRAME: MANNOSE| and |FRAME: SUCROSE|,
COMMENT - /which are processed into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|.
COMMENT - /D-fructose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis and is processed to the end product pyruvate, which is often fermented

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Vitamin B12 (also known as adenosylcobalamin or |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|) was discovered in the 1920s after Minot and Murphy reported that they could cure the symptoms of pernicious anaemia by feeding patients with crude liver extract |CITS: [Minot26]| (they received the Nobel prize in 1934 for this discovery).
COMMENT - /The unknown factor has been isolated and subsequently crystallized in 1948 |CITS:[Lester48][Rickes48]|, and was given the name vitamin B12 and, as it was shown to contain a cobalt ion, cobalamin |CITS: [12195810]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is one of the most structurally complex small molecules made in Nature. It contains a contracted porphinoid ring with a cobalt ion ligated at its center and further held in place by a lower axial base (a dimethylbenzimidazole) and an upper methyl or adenosyl group. Its biosynthesis is similarly complex, and requires more than thirty genes. It's biosynthesis is confined to only some bacteria and archaea |CITS: [11935176]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Two main pathways are known for |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN| biosynthesis - an aerobic pathway (see |FRAME:P381-PWY|) and an anaerobic pathway (this pathway). The main differences between these pathways are the timing of the |FRAME: CO+2| ion insertion and the ring-contraction mechanism (for more about ring contraction, see |CITS: [16592942]|). |FRAME: CO+2| is inserted early on in the anaerobic pathway, and rather late in the aerobic pathway.
COMMENT - /The two different routes then merge at |FRAME: CPD-689|, and the latter part of the pathway is identical, or at least very similar.

COMMENT - /The biosynthesis of |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN| starts with the biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole intermediate |FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|, a common intermediate in the biosynthesis of several important compounds such as |FRAME: Hemes heme| and |FRAME: Chlorophylls chlorophyl|. |FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III "Uroporphyrinogen-III"| is converted to a corrin ring by a complex process that involves (among other things) the attachment of eight methyl groups, all derived from |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM).
COMMENT - /During the process the ring contracts via bonding of carbons C-1 and C-19, eliminating carbon C-20 from the ring. This contraction process converts the ring from a porphyrin ring to a corrin ring. Both the C-20 carbon and the added C-20 methyl group are lost in the form of |FRAME: ACETALD|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The intermediates formed prior to the formation of the corrin ring are called precorrins. The precorrins are numbered corresponding to the number of methyl groups that have been already introduced. If two different intermediates have the same number of methyl groups, they are also labeled by A or B (as in |FRAME:CPD-675|). If there is still some uncertainty about an intermediate, it is given a temporary designation of X or Y.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /There is indeed some uncertainty about the path from |FRAME: DIHYDROSIROHYDROCHLORIN| to |FRAME: CPD-9040|. Early work, performed mostly with |FRAME: TAX-28901|, suggested that this transition may be catalyzed in two steps - the insertion of cobalt into |FRAME: DIHYDROSIROHYDROCHLORIN|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: G-10021|, followed by methylation by |FRAME: G-10057|. However, information gathered from multiple studies, most recently with the aerobic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1404| that posseses a complete anaerobic pathway, suggests that this conversion may proceed through the oxidized factor intermediates, which is favored for the ease of cobalt insertion. Thus, |FRAME: DIHYDROSIROHYDROCHLORIN| is first oxidized to |FRAME: SIROHYDROCHLORIN| by |FRAME: STM3477|. Cobalt in then inserted (either by |FRAME: G-10021| or |FRAME: G-11338|), followed by methylation to |FRAME: COBALT-FACTOR-III| and reduction to |FRAME: CPD-9040| |CITS: [12408752][17567575][16042604][12917443][12686546][23155054]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The first intermediate with a corrin ring is |FRAME:CPD-9049|. However, this intermediate still needs to be modified extensively. Successive amidation reactions transfer amide groups from two |FRAME: GLN| molecules to the carboxy groups <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, resulting in |FRAME:CPD-689| - the point where the early-insertion and late-insertion pathways combine.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Additional steps in the pathway of cobalamin biosynthesis are described in |FRAME: PWY-5509| and |FRAME: PWY-5507|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The pentose phosphate pathway is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /<b>About This Pathway</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
COMMENT - /|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
COMMENT - /|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
COMMENT - /In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.

COMMENT - <b>Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /During fermentative growth, formate is produced via |FRAME: PYRUVFORMLY-CPLX "pyruvate formate lyase"| (PFL) from pyruvate. The physiological function of the FHL reaction is to prevent acidification of the cytoplasm by converting formate to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| and the FHL complex can effectively function at a pH lower than 7.0. Recently, a potential second |FRAME: HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| evolving hydrogenase Hyd-4 encoded by the <i>hyf</i> operon was identified in |FRAME:TAX-562|. This system has been designated FHL-2 and is driven by the F0F1-ATPase and is composed of Hyd4 and FdhH. Hydrogen production via the Hyd-3 and Fdh-H-dependent pathway versus the Hyd-4, Fdh-H and F0F1-ATPase-dependent pathway has been shown to be pH dependent |CITS: [11959127]|.

COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /|FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGH-MONOMER "Formate dehydrogenase H"| (FDH) and |FRAME: HYDROG3-CPLX| together form the membrane |FRAME: FHLMULTI-CPLX| (FHL-1) of |FRAME: TAX-562|. It oxidizes endogenously produced formate to produce carbon dioxide and passes the generated electrons to |FRAME: PROTON| to evolve |FRAME: HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| under anaerobic conditions |CITS: [2187144]| |CITS: [1625581]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Formate dehydrogenase H, a <i>FdhF</i> encoded selenopolypeptide, catalyzes the oxidation of formate generating |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and transferring the electrons to hydrogenase 3, which is the first part of the reaction |CITS: [13449036]|. Hydrogenase 3 is encoded by by the <i>hyc</i> operon which has eight ORFs, <i>hycA, hycB, hycC, hycD, hycE, hycF, hycG</i> and <i>hycH</i> |CITS: [21261819]| |CITS: [1812811]|. A model has been proposed that demonstrates how FdhF tranfers electrons to the catalytic subunit HycE of hydrogenase 3 via HycB, HycF and HycG subunits. HycB and HycF are both [4Fe-4S] ferredoxin type electron transport proteins, while HycE and HycG have homology to NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NUO) subunits of mitochondria and chloroplasts |CITS: [2187144]|. The model demonstrates electron transfer from FdhF to HycB to HycF to HycG to HycE, with HycC and HycD acting as membrane anchoring proteins |CITS: [1625581]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The product of <i>hycH</i> is required for the conversion of a precursor form of HycE into the mature form but is not part of the functional FHL complex |CITS: [1625581]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /HycA is a FHL repressor protein encoded by <i>hycA</i>, which represses the <i>hyc</i> operon |CITS: [11931558]|, and its deletion results in increased FDH-H and hydrogenase activity |CITS: [1625581]|. The <i>fhlA</i> gene encodes the FHL activator protein FhlA which also controls the transcription of the FHL complex |CITS: [16269707]|. FhlA promotes the transcription of the <i>fdhF, hyc and hyp</i> operons |CITS: [10848985]| |CITS: [2280686]|. It might be possible to control FHL activity and the hydrogen production rate by manipulating <i>fhlA</i> and <i>hycA</i> |CITS: [16269707]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The biosynthesis of the FHL complex is controlled by the concentration of formate in the cell |CITS: [16269707]||CITS: [1779767]|. Selenium and molybdenum are necessary at the active site of FDH-H, and nickel is necessary at the active site of Hyd-3 |CITS: [9036855]| |CITS: [1482271]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3601235850:fulcher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are
COMMENT - /determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|,
COMMENT - /and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in
COMMENT - /mammals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see
COMMENT - /|FRAME: CPLX-7628| from |FRAME: TAX-9606|), while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast)
COMMENT - /consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex
COMMENT - /(see |FRAME: CPLX-7627| from |FRAME: TAX-4932|).
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794|
COMMENT - /phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|.
COMMENT - /The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each
COMMENT - /encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as
COMMENT - /thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The best studied pathway is that of |FRAME: TAX-83333|, from which all the enzymes have been purified
COMMENT - /and crystalized. In plants fatty acid synthesis occurs mainly in plastids of leaf mesophyll cells, seeds,
COMMENT - /and oil-accumulating fruits. Although most of the synthesis occurrs in plastids, it has been shown that
COMMENT - /mitochondria are also capable of synthesizing fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|,
COMMENT - /an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately
COMMENT - /produce the final fatty acid products. This superpathway describes only the initiation sequence,
COMMENT - /subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and
COMMENT - /|FRAME: PWY0-862|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /<b>About This Pathway</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /|FRAME: TAX-83333| has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, using
COMMENT - /different combinations of its three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS),
COMMENT - /|FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|,
COMMENT - /which are encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.
COMMENT - /In general, the |FRAME: EG10277|-encoded enzyme is responsible for the initiation of fatty acid
COMMENT - /elongation, utilizing acyl-coA primers, while the |FRAME: EG10274|/|FRAME: EG12606| products
COMMENT - /are responsible for the subsequent rounds of elongation, condensing malonyl-ACP with different length
COMMENT - /acyl-ACPs to extend the acyl chain by two carbons |CITS: [15952903][18384517]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Three pathways for the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis have been proposed |CITS: [1551888]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In the first pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-4381|) |FRAME: CPLX0-252| catalyzes the condensation of
COMMENT - /|FRAME: ACETYL-COA| with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| to yield |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In the second pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-5966|) the acetate moiety is first transferred from
COMMENT - /|FRAME: ACETYL-COA| to |FRAME: ACETYL-ACP| by |FRAME:ACP-S-ACETYLTRANSFER-ENZRXN|
COMMENT - /(this is a second function of |FRAME: CPLX0-252|; it is not clear whether an additional dedicated
COMMENT - /enzyme exists in the organism). The acetyl-ACP is then condensed with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|
COMMENT - /by |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| (or alternatively |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX|).
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /The third pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-5965|) involves the decarboxylation of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|
COMMENT - /by |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| to form |FRAME: ACETYL-ACP| followed by subsequent condensation with
COMMENT - /a second |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /It is now believed that |FRAME: CPLX0-252| is the key enzyme in the initiation of fatty acids biosynthesis
COMMENT - /|CITS: [15952903]|. It selectively catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP and specifically uses CoA
COMMENT - /thioesters rather than acyl-ACP as the primer. The products tend to be shorter than the products of KASI
COMMENT - /and II, which are involved primarily in elongation reactions, and unlike the other two enzymes, KASIII
COMMENT - /cannot participate in the terminal elongation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /While |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| and |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| have been shown <i>in
COMMENT - /vitro</i> to utilize substrates with short acyl moieties, forming acetoacetyl-ACP,
COMMENT - /the importance of these enzyme for initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis <i>in vivo</i> is not clear

COMMON-NAME - triacylglycerol degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3601229717:fulcher
COMMENT - Triacylglycerol (TAG) degradation is critical to many plants for which lipids rather than carbohydrates are
COMMENT - /the major seed storage reserves. The breakdown of the seed storage lipid provides carbon skeletons and
COMMENT - /energy that can drive postgerminative plant growth before the plant root system and photosynthetic
COMMENT - /capacity are fully established.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /TAG degradation occurs in the seed oil body where TAG is deposited and stored. The liberated free
COMMENT - /fatty acids are transported to glyoxysomes where they are converted to acetyl-CoAs via the beta
COMMENT - /oxidation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5136|). The acetyl-CoAs are eventually converted to carbohydrates via glyoxylate
COMMENT - /cycle (|FRAME: PWY-561|). It is generally thought that the hydrolytic attack of TAG primarily occurs at the sn-1 or
COMMENT - /sn-3 positions but not the sn-2 position. Sn-2 monoacylglycerols are naturally racemized to sn-1
COMMENT - /monoacylglycerols to be completely hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipases (pg255
COMMENT - /in |CITS: [plantbiochemistry97]|).
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /Despite the importance of the pathway for plants, there is still not much known about the plant enzymes
COMMENT - /and genes of the pathway, especially di- and mono-acylglycerol lipases. To date, only an Arabidopsis
COMMENT - /triacylglycerol lipase has been biochemically and genetically proven to play a role in the breakdown of
COMMENT - /seed storage TAG during seed germination.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> the degradation of TAG and phospholipids is taking place in the lipid droplets |CITS:[16916618] [22345606]| where all the tri- to monoacylglycerol lipases of yeast have been shown to be located and enzymatically active |CITS:[10515935] [16135509]|. The major TAG lipase TGL3p also exhibited DAG lipase activity <i>in vitro</i> |CITS:[16267052]|. The other TAG lipase of importance in yeast, i.e. TGL4 has even been demonstrated to represent a multi-functional enzyme which also acts as steryl ester hydrolase, sn-1 and sn-2 phospholipase A2 and acyl-CoA dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase |CITS:[20332534]|. In addition, the TAG lipase TGL5 has been found to be bifunctional and furthermore catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphilipids |CITS:[20016004]| indicating that TAG lipase enzymes of yeast are likewise involved in catabolic and anabolic pathways of fatty acid metabolism. The <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> activity of the only monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) in yeast encoded by YJU3 has been demonstrated in &Delta;yju3 mutants which showed no MGL activity but could be rescued by murine monoacylglycerol lipase (mMGL). Moreover, heterologous expressed and purified YJU3 enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed both |FRAME:CPD-11690| and |FRAME:CPD0-1812| to yield |FRAME:GLYCEROL| and |FRAME:OLEATE-CPD| |CITS:[20554061]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) is a side product of the |FRAME: BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-1303| pathways.  Many organisms are able to recycle MTA via the |FRAME: PWY-4361 "methionine salvage"| pathway, but others, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, are not able to recycle it.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: CPLX0-1541| hydrolyzes MTA to adenine and |FRAME: CPD-560| (MTR). MTR can not be further metabolized and is excreted out of the cell |CITS: [16788729]|.  No transporter for MTR is currently known.

COMMENT - <b>Background</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /There is renewed interest in lignocellulosic biomass as a renewable feedstock for the production of |FRAME: ETOH| and other chemicals as result of increasing fuel costs and limited resources for fossil fuels |CITS: [16672461]|.  |FRAME: ETOH "Ethanol"| production from lignocellulose is not a straightforward process. |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| form a complex with |FRAME: Lignins "lignin"| and need to be liberated first by delignification. |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| then need to be depolymerized to release free sugars such as |FRAME: Glucose "glucose"| and |FRAME: XYLOSE "xylose" |. These mixed hexose and pentose sugars then require fermentation to produce |FRAME: ETOH| |CITS: [9246788]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /With the release of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| from delignification, low acid concentrations will hydrolyze |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| into monomeric sugars, while fungal cellulases are required to hydrolyze |FRAME: CELLULOSE| to glucose in a process called saccharification |CITS: [16209550]|. Fermentation of glucose to ethanol is also carried out by fungal cellulases which function optimally at 50&deg;C and pH 5.0 |CITS: [10514249]|. The component pentose sugar of hemicellulose, xylose is not easily converted to ethanol by any organism but can be converted to lactate by lactic acid bacteria using the |FRAME: P122-PWY| pathway |CITS: [1660563]|. |FRAME: Lactate "Lactate"| can be used as a source of lactic acid polymers to create biodegradeable plastics |CITS: [15269531]|. The conversion of xylose to lactate by lactic acid bacteria has limitations industrially as two of the five carbons in the pentose are converted to |FRAME: ACET| |CITS: [11800488]|.

COMMENT - /<b>About this Pathway</b>
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - / |FRAME: TAX-1398| is a newly identified Gram-positive thermophilic bacterial strain that can grow and ferment at pH 5.0 and temperatures of 60&deg;C, conditions optimal for the hydrolysis of cellulose by fungal cellulases |CITS: [15269531]|. This strain can convert both glucose and xylose to lactate |CITS: [16672461]|. The conversion of xylose to lactate in |FRAME: TAX-1398| utilizes the |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY|, unlike in other lactic acid bacteria which utilize the |FRAME: P122-PWY| pathway |CITS: [1660563]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /It should be noted that while |FRAME: TAX-1398| is thermophilic, and fungal cellulases function optimally at 50&deg;C, one of the enzymes in this pathway |FRAME: CPLX-8356| is thermolabile, and is rendered non-functional at 55&deg;C |CITS: [7462149]|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of hexitol degradation (bacteria)
CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3601235850:fulcher
COMMENT - Of the ten existing hexitols (|FRAME: CPD-15703|, |FRAME: CPD-12811|, |FRAME: CPD-15702|, |FRAME: SORBITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-12810|, |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-15701|, |FRAME: CPD-357|, |FRAME: CPD-369| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|) only three occur naturally - |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: SORBITOL| (also known as D-glucitol), and |FRAME: GALACTITOL| (owing to symmetry, D- and L-galactitol are identical).
COMMENT - /|FRAME: MANNITOL| is the most abundant polyol in nature, and is found in bacteria, fungi, algae, lichens and vascular plants.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /All three naturally-occurring hexitols can be utilized by bacteria as a total source of carbon and energy.
COMMENT - /Each of these hexitols enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system, so the first intracellular species is the 6-phospho-derivative |CITS: [1100608]| (note that due to symmetry of |FRAME: MANNITOL| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|, their phosphorylation at either end produces the same molecule. When these molecules are phosphorylated at the 6 position by the PTS system, the resulting molecules are named |FRAME: MANNITOL-1P| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL-1-PHOSPHATE|, respectively, by conventional nomenclature rules).
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In all three cases this sugar alcohol phosphate becomes the substrate for a dehydrogenase that oxidizes its 2-alcohol group to a keto group. In the cases of |FRAME: MANNITOL| and |FRAME: SORBITOL|, the resulting keto sugar phosphate is |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|, an intermediate of glycolysis, and hence it flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy |CITS: [6384188][2111176]|.
COMMENT - /
COMMENT - /In the case of |FRAME: GALACTITOL-1-PHOSPHATE|, however, the product of the dehydrogenation is |FRAME: TAGATOSE-6-PHOSPHATE|, which becomes the substrate of a kinase and subsequently an aldolase (in a pair of reactions that parallel those of glycolysis) before it is converted into intermediates (|FRAME: GAP| and
COMMENT - /|FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|) of glycolysis |CITS: [8955298]|.
